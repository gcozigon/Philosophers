# Philosophers

Philosophers is a project that implements the Dining Philosophers Problem, a classic example in computer science for studying synchronization and concurrency. 

The objective is to create a simulation where several philosophers take turns thinking, eating, and sleeping, while competing for a limited number of shared forks.

The challenge lies in ensuring proper synchronization between the philosophers using multithreading or multiprocessing, while preventing deadlocks and handling resource contention.

# Skills
The project is coded in C and offers valuable insights into concurrent programming, thread coordination, mutex usage, and strategies for avoiding race conditions.
